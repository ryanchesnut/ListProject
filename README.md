## Requirements
• Use Angular 2+ with TypeScript. You can use any package manager and/ or boilerplate you’d like.

• No need for a back-end or persistent storage. If something needs to be stored it can be stored in memory (objects).

• Bonus points for a nice UI and UX.


Description:

• Create an app that has two lists side by side. Both lists should work exactly the same and a user should be able to interact with either list.

• Each list can have any number of items. Each item should be an image thumbnail.

• When the app starts, one or both of the lists should have a few items pre-loaded.

• The app needs to allow moving items between lists. How this is implemented, and how many items can be moved with one action, is left up to the developer.

• Every time an item is moved between lists, a counter (for each item) is incremented. When the app starts all counters should be set to zero. When an items’s counter reaches 5, that item is frozen in that list - meaning that we can no longer move it between lists.

• This counter should be displayed for each item. How and where this counter is displayed is up to the developer.

# ListProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
